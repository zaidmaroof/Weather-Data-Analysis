Weather Data Analysis & Visualization

This project demonstrates foundational data analysis and visualization skills by fetching and analyzing real-time weather data. The application uses a weather API to retrieve data, performs a detailed analysis of key metrics, and visualizes the findings to provide clear insights.
Key Features

    Real-time Data Fetching: Automatically retrieves real-time weather data from a public API.

    Data Analysis: Analyzes key weather metrics such as maximum, minimum, and average temperature and humidity.

    Data Visualization: Generates informative graphs and plots to visualize temperature and humidity trends over a specified period.

    Data Persistence: Saves the fetched and processed data into a CSV file for future use and historical analysis.

    Command-Line Interface: Includes a simple command-line interface for ease of use.

Technologies Used

    Python: The core programming language.

    requests: For making API calls to fetch external data.

    Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.

    Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating high-quality data visualizations.

How to Run

    Clone this repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/zaidmaroof/Weather-Data-Analysis.git

    Install the required libraries:
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn requests

    Run the main script:
    python main_script.py

Future Enhancements

    Predictive Modeling: Use scikit-learn to build a simple regression model that predicts future temperature based on historical data.

    Additional Metrics: Extend the analysis to include other metrics like wind speed, pressure, and precipitation.

    Interactive Visualization: Implement an interactive dashboard using a library like Plotly to allow users to explore the data dynamically.
